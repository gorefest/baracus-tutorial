BUILDING THE EXAMPLES

You MUST set the sdk path (I am developing and compiling under several machines, so there are profiles!) and activate
Your matching profile on a maven build.

Example : Windows Machine, Android SDK under C:\sdk\android\
-> Modify the pom's android.sdk.path in the windows profile and build the app via mvn clean install -Pwindows
